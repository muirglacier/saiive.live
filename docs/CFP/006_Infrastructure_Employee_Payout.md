# Describe the purpose
Infrastructure and employee payout for 2022/Q1 as described in out Business Plan here [GitHub Initial CFP](https://github.com/DeFiCh/dfips/issues/13).

To be transparent with you - we have currently have infrastructure costs of about €2500,-/month. Blockchain needs a lot of storage,
which is very expensive in the cloud. Additionally we are in talk with a UI/UX developer to further improve the saiive.live DeFi Wallet!

For reference, here is our Business Plan which was approved in our first proposal.

# Next Steps

Let me give you some insights what our plan for 2022 is:

 - We need to have better communication. We had good help from a community member, due to personal issues, he is out for couple of months. So we are searching for new Help in that matter
 - Video Tutorials: We want to make onboarding of saiive.live easier and faster. Therefore we plan to make Video Tutorials to show how it works.
 - Written Tutorials: As well as Video Tutorials, we also want to make a Blog to release the Tutorials there.
 - Ledger Support: one of the main asked features for Defichain. And one of the most important one!
