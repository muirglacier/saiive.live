  "loan_faq_collateral_ratio_answer": "The collateralization ratio determines the state of the vault. A ratio below the minimum collaterization ratio results in liquidation, upon which, a vault's collaterals will be sent for auction.\n\nIndicators have been included to help visualise the health of your vault, where:\n\nRed: 1x – 1.25x above the minimum collateralization ratio\n\nYellow: 1.25x – 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio\n\nGreen: More than 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio",
  "loan_faq_vault_status": "What does the different status of a vault mean?",
  "loan_faq_vault_status_answer": "Active: When a vault has been created but no loan has been taken yet\n\nAt risk: When the collateralization ratio of a vault is between 1x – 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio\n\nHealthy: When the collateralization ratio of a vault is more than 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio\n\nIn liquidation: When a vault's collateralization ratio falls below the minimum requirement\n\nHalted: When any token in the vault (collateral or loan) has fluctuated more than 30% in the past hour",
  "loan_faq_vault_interests": "How are interests calculated for loan?",
  "loan_faq_vault_interests_answer": "There are 2 types of interests that applies for loans, namely vault interest rate and token interest rate.\n\nThe vault interest rate is determined when the vault owner selects the vault scheme, where the higher the minimum collateralization ratio, the lower the vault interest rate.\n\nThe token interest rate is applied on specific loan tokens, and can differ from token to token.\n\nThe total interest rate applied on a loan is derived by taking the vault interest rate + token interest rate, and is calculated on a per annum basis.",
  "loan_faq_vault_factor": "What is collateral factor?",
  "loan_faq_vault_factor_answer": "The collateral factor determines the degree of contribution of each collateral token. For example, if a token is accepted at 70% collateral factor, $100 worth of the token would contribute to $70 of collateral value in a vault.",
